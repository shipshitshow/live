## Talking Points — Livestream Notes

### Segment Thesis

Okay, so this segment is about Livestream Notes.

### Talking Points

- Title: **[LIVE] Stop Planning With Markdown. HTML Is Better.**
- [YouTube livestream](https://youtube.com/live/vI0VlQ5lULo)
- [Restream studio](https://studio.restream.io/eue-pcqd-vbw)
- Format: talk + live build
- Build: GitHub Repo Roaster — paste any public repo URL, Claude reads it, outputs brutal HTML roast report
- Key moment: side-by-side markdown blob vs opening HTML in browser live

## Cold Open — Read This

> "An Anthropic engineer posted something this week that broke my brain."

> "He said: stop using markdown for Claude output. Use HTML instead."

> "I've been using markdown for everything. Every plan. Every code review. Every spec. Three years of markdown files."

> "So I tested it. He was right."

> "Today we're going to prove it live. We're building a tool that roasts your GitHub repos — and every single plan, spec, and output we generate will be HTML. No markdown."

> "Submit your repos in chat. Nothing will be safe."

## Talking Points — The History (5 min)

### Segment Thesis

Okay, so this segment is about The History (5 min).

### Talking Points

- Markdown became default AI output format during GPT-4 era — tiny context windows, every token counted
- Made sense then. 8K context. Minimize tokens. Markdown was efficient.
- Context windows are now 1 million tokens. Agents are powerful. Markdown is a bottleneck.
- Nobody updated the default. Everyone kept generating markdown blobs.

## Talking Points — Why HTML Wins

### Segment Thesis

Okay, so this segment is about Why HTML Wins.

### Talking Points

- **Information density** — HTML packs tables, SVG, CSS, JavaScript, images, interactions into one file
- **Readability** — past 100 lines, markdown is effectively unreadable. HTML stays navigable.
- **Shareability** — HTML file = open in browser, share a link. Markdown = needs a renderer.
- **Two-way interaction** — HTML supports sliders, toggles, copy buttons, editors that pipe back to the agent
- **Joy factor** — reading well-crafted HTML is a different experience. Markdown brackets are noise.

## Talking Points — The Live Build — GitHub Repo Roaster

### Segment Thesis

Okay, so this segment is about The Live Build — GitHub Repo Roaster.

### Talking Points

- Paste any public GitHub repo URL
- Claude reads the code
- Outputs brutal HTML roast report with: shame score (0–100), hall of shame, color-coded crime categories, "What were they thinking?" section
- The product IS the HTML output — no separate frontend needed
- Chat submits repos live = infinite content

**Step 1 — Show the old way (2 min)**
- Ask Claude to plan the app in markdown. Show the blob. Read it out. Point out how bad it is to navigate.

**Step 2 — Same prompt, HTML output (2 min)**
- Re-prompt with HTML instruction. Open the file in browser. Let the audience react.

**Step 3 — Build the roaster (15 min)**
- Use HTML output for every plan step. Claude Code builds the tool. Show HTML specs, HTML architecture docs, HTML progress reports as it builds.

**Step 4 — First roast (live)**
- Start with a famous repo: `left-pad` (4 lines of code, broke the internet) or `is-odd` (npm package, 500M downloads)

**Step 5 — Open chat**
- Take 3–5 submissions from chat. Roast live.

## Talking Points — The Build Prompt

### Segment Thesis

Okay, so this segment is about The Build Prompt.

### Talking Points

> Build a GitHub repo roaster. Given a public GitHub repo URL: fetch the repo structure and key files using the GitHub API, analyze the code for naming crimes, architectural disasters, copy-paste evidence, dead code, security issues, unnecessary complexity, then output a single self-contained HTML file with a shame score (0–100), hall of shame (worst 5 offenders with code snippets), color-coded crime categories, "What were they thinking?" section with specific quotes from the code, and a shareable styled report that opens in any browser. Output your implementation plan as HTML first, then build it.

## Closing Take

> "Every plan we made today was HTML. Every spec. Every review. Open in browser, readable immediately, shareable instantly."

> "Markdown made sense when tokens were expensive. Tokens aren't expensive anymore."

> "The format was wrong. The tool was right all along."

> "Submit your repos in chat."

## Tweets — Paste Live

> Anthropic's Claude Code engineer said stop using markdown for AI output. Use HTML. Karpathy agreed. We're testing it live today — building a GitHub repo roaster where every plan, spec and output is HTML. Submit your repos in chat.

> Side by side: Claude markdown plan = wall of brackets nobody wants to read. Claude HTML plan = opens in browser, styled, navigable, shareable. Same prompt. Completely different experience.

> [repo name] just got roasted by Claude. HTML report. Shame score: [X]/100. Share this.

## Talking Points — Host Notes

### Segment Thesis

Okay, so this segment is about Host Notes.

### Talking Points

- Push on: the browser open moment. Let it breathe. Let audience react.
- Avoid: don't over-explain HTML. Everyone knows what a browser is.
- Pull up: Thariq's 20 examples BEFORE the build — sets expectations.
- If build breaks: roast the broken code live. That's content too.
- Keep chat open for repo submissions from first mention.
