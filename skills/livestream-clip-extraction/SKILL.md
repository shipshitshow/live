# Livestream Clip Extraction

Use this skill to turn long Ship Shit Show streams into discovery assets. Optimize for viewers who have never seen the channel.

## Quick Start

1. Load the relevant topic file from `apps/app/data/livestream/YYYY-MM-DD/topic-*.md`.
2. Load the transcript, preferring `apps/app/data/transcripts/clean/*.txt`; use raw `.vtt` when timestamps are required.
3. If available, check YouTube performance signals for recent clips and videos.
4. Extract 6-12 candidates, then rank down to the top 3-5 to publish first.
5. Output clip packages with timestamp range, hook, thesis, title, caption, thumbnail prompt, and why it should be discoverable.

## Source Priority

Prefer sources in this order:

1. Raw VTT transcript when exact timestamps matter.
2. Clean transcript when judging clip quality and phrasing.
3. Topic markdown for intended thesis, sources, and segment structure.
4. YouTube Data/Analytics signals for what packaging already works.
5. External trend research only when the clip depends on a fresh news hook.

Do not invent quotes, timestamps, metrics, or reactions. If a timestamp is approximate, label it `approx`.

## Discovery Bias

Clips are not episode summaries. A clip should work cold in a feed.

Prioritize clips with:

- named model/tool/company in the first 2 seconds
- a visible tension: versus, failure, cost, risk, surprise, or proof
- one concrete noun: bill, benchmark, repo, token, npm, CAD, FPS, agent trace
- a line that can become the title
- a complete mini-arc without needing the full livestream
- a clip line the viewer can steal, not a "agree?" / "what do you think?" beg

Downrank clips that:

- start with context setup, greetings, or "we were talking about"
- need more than 5 seconds before the topic is clear
- rely on inside jokes or channel lore
- summarize news without an operator take
- use generic text like "AI is changing everything"
- close on engagement bait ("agree?", "comment if", "what do you think?")
- are visually static unless the quote is unusually strong

## Clip Types

Use a mix, not one format repeated:

- **Model fight:** OpenAI vs Anthropic, Claude vs GPT, cheap vs smart.
- **Build proof:** something works or fails on screen.
- **Operator warning:** a concrete risk builders should stop ignoring.
- **Cost/bill reveal:** the money changes the decision.
- **Hot take:** lazy consensus vs useful builder take.
- **Failure autopsy:** what broke, why it broke, and what the harness should have done.

## Ranking Rubric

Score each candidate 1-5:

- **Hook speed:** named topic and tension by second 2.
- **Standalone clarity:** understandable without the full stream.
- **Discovery surface:** likely search/browse keywords in title and first line.
- **Clip line:** one quotable sentence.
- **Visual proof:** screen action, source, chart, app, terminal, or clear facial reaction.
- **Operator value:** viewer leaves with a decision, warning, or workflow rule.

Publish first when total score is high and the title is obvious. If two clips tie, pick the one with stronger visual proof.

## Output Format

For topic markdown files, use dashboard-safe headings:

```markdown
## Talking Points — Clip Candidates

### Segment Thesis

These are the Shorts/cutdowns most likely to drive discovery from the stream.

### Talking Points

- **Clip:** 00:12:34-00:13:08 approx
- **Type:** Model fight / Build proof / Operator warning / Cost reveal / Hot take / Failure autopsy
- **Hook text:** 3-7 words for on-screen text
- **Title:** <= 70 chars, no vague hype
- **Thesis:** one sentence
- **Why it works:** discovery reason
- **Caption:** 1-2 sentence Shorts caption
- **Thumbnail prompt:** optional if not a vertical crop
- **Hashtags:** 3-5 specific tags
- **Risk:** context needed, factual check, weak audio, visual mismatch, etc.

### Host Notes

- Publish order:
- Needs timestamp verification:
- Repurpose into:
```

For standalone clip plans, use a compact table plus separate packages for the top 3.

## Packaging Rules

- Shorts title target: 35-60 characters.
- Main-channel cutdown title target: 45-75 characters.
- First caption sentence must repeat the hook in different words.
- Use 3-5 hashtags max; prefer specific tags like `#ClaudeCode`, `#AICoding`, `#CursorAI`, `#SoftwareEngineering`.
- Do not put every AI lab in the title. Pick the conflict.
- Avoid "insane", "crazy", "game-changing" unless the clip earns it with a receipt.
- For build clips, title the observable result, not the tool: `Claude 4.8 Built CAD In One Prompt`, not `Testing Claude`.

## Thumbnails

Thumbnail prompts, art direction, image paths, and livestream vs recap vs surgical modes are owned by `$thumbnails`. Do not restate those rules here. Invoke that skill.

When a clip package includes `Thumbnail prompt`, invoke `$thumbnails`. Shorts, cutdowns, and recaps use that skill's recap/cutdown mode unless the user explicitly asks for livestream archive branding.

## YouTube Performance Check

When the user asks what performs best:

1. Try private YouTube Analytics first if valid OAuth tokens exist.
2. If Analytics tokens fail, use public YouTube Data API channel/video stats.
3. Compare main vs clips separately: views, average views per upload, likes, comments, subscribers, and top recent videos.
4. Translate the result into packaging rules for the current stream.

If tokens return `invalid_grant`, say reauth is needed and continue with public stats if possible.

## Verification

Before finalizing:

- Every clip has a named subject in the title.
- Every clip has a first-second hook or on-screen text.
- Timestamped clips are backed by VTT or video source.
- Claims copied from the stream are not "cleaned up" into stronger claims than were spoken.
- The first publish batch includes at least one build-proof clip when the stream includes live coding.
- The output favors discovery over archival completeness.
- Clip thumbnail prompts came from `$thumbnails` in recap/cutdown mode, not livestream two-host episode-number style.
