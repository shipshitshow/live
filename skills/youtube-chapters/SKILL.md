# YouTube Chapters

Use this skill to produce YouTube-ready chapters from transcript evidence. The output is a navigation aid, not a summary.

## Quick Start

1. Prefer raw `.vtt` captions when exact timestamps matter.
2. Use clean transcripts or episode notes only to name sections; verify timestamps against VTT when available.
3. Generate 6-12 chapters for normal videos and 8-18 chapters for livestreams.
4. Keep every chapter title to **3 words max**.
5. Output a plain timestamp list that can be pasted into a YouTube description.

## Timestamp Sources

Prefer sources in this order:

1. Raw VTT: `apps/app/data/transcripts/*.vtt`
2. Existing YouTube description chapters, if present
3. Clean transcript: `apps/app/data/transcripts/clean/*.txt`
4. Topic notes or episode metadata

Do not invent exact timestamps from clean transcript text. If only clean text exists, label timestamps `approx` or ask for VTT/video when exact chapters are required.

## Optional Draft Helper

Use the parser to create rough time-bucket chapter candidates from VTT:

```bash
python3 skills/youtube-chapters/scripts/draft_chapters.py path/to/transcript.vtt
```

Treat script output as a draft. Rewrite titles for meaning, remove weak buckets, and enforce the 3-word maximum.

## Chapter Rules

- First chapter must start at `0:00`.
- Format timestamps as `M:SS` or `H:MM:SS`.
- Use exact VTT timestamps when available.
- Title each chapter with 1-3 words.
- Prefer concrete nouns: `Opus Setup`, `First Build`, `Boss Fight`, `Cost Reality`.
- Avoid filler: `Introduction`, `Overview`, `Discussion`, `Conclusion`, `Final Thoughts`.
- Avoid punctuation-heavy titles unless needed for a product name.
- Space chapters by real topic turns, not fixed intervals.
- For YouTube compatibility, include at least 3 chapters and keep the first timestamp exactly `0:00`.

## Naming Style

Use Ship Shit Show phrasing: short, direct, builder-native.

Good:

```text
0:00 Cold Open
0:42 Opus Test
2:06 First Build
5:49 Boss Fight
10:26 Final Run
13:28 Get It
```

Bad:

```text
0:00 Introduction And Context
0:42 Discussing Claude Opus 4.8 Model Capabilities
2:06 We Start Looking At The First Build
```

## Output Contract

Return this structure unless the user asks for a different format:

```markdown
### Chapters

0:00 Cold Open
0:42 Opus Test
2:06 First Build
```

If timestamps are approximate:

```markdown
### Chapters

0:00 Cold Open approx
```

## Verification

Before finalizing:

- Every chapter title is 3 words max.
- The first chapter starts at `0:00`.
- Timestamps are monotonic.
- Chapters are backed by VTT/video when presented as exact.
- The list can be pasted directly into a YouTube description.
